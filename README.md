## 📚 About
synthdb is "The Universal Database Seeder." It generates realistic synthetic data for PostgreSQL databases without needing any configuration. This tool helps you fill your database with meaningful data while maintaining important relationships and logical structure.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with synthdb, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Computer**
   Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from the official [PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

2. **Download synthdb**
   Visit this page to download: [synthdb Releases](https://github.com/Dgossaye/synthdb/releases). You will find the latest version available for download.

3. **Install synthdb**
   After downloading, locate the file you downloaded, typically in your "Downloads" folder.

4. **Run the Application**
   Double-click the downloaded file to start the installation. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the installation process.

5. **Setup Your Database**
   Open PostgreSQL and create a new database where you want to seed your data. You will need the database name, user, and password for the next steps.

6. **Seed Your Database**
   Open a terminal or command prompt. You can do this by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu (Windows) or "Terminal" in macOS.

   Use the following command to seed your database:
   ```
   synthdb seed --database your_database_name --user your_username --password your_password
   ```
   Replace `your_database_name`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your actual database details.

7. **Verify Your Data**
   After running the command, open your PostgreSQL database to check that it has been filled with synthetic data. You can use a database management tool like pgAdmin or DBeaver for easier viewing.
